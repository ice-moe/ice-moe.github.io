			<h2>產學攜手合作計畫 Industrial-Academic Cooperation Project</h2>
			<p>The Industrial-Academic Cooperation Project integrates further education of both vocational high schools (or junior colleges) and colleges of technology and science. It also promotes collaboration between schools and industry in different ways at different stages so as to supply industry with qualified technicians.</p>
			<p>By connecting vocational high schools with colleges of technology and science and providing students with internships and stipends, it is able to offer students opportunities of education and career at the same time. Schools are thus encouraged to develop courses that are career-oriented and correspond to the development of a community. Underprivileged students will be more willing to pursue further education and develop a career plan. Students with special needs will be motivated through hands-on practice and eventually cultivate practical expertise. Collaborating companies benefit from a steady supply of qualified technicians. An innovative mode of education is developed to assist students in identifying their occupational aptitude. A system featuring a more flexible transition will also be promoted for special subjects in vocational high schools. It emphasizes both theory and practicalities so that industry’s requirements on technicians can be fulfilled. Industry and schools should collaborate by integrating teaching with internships and assisting students in acquiring licenses together. The practical feature of vocational education, i.e., “learning by doing and doing by learning” can thus be implemented. Underprivileged students will be given priority for admission.</p>
			<p>The fields focused in the projects are Moulding Industry, Mechanical Engineering, Ultra-precision Manufacturing, Navigation Industry, Aircraft Maintenance, Yacht In-dustry, Semiconductor Industry, Textile Industry, Apparel Industry, Surface Treat-ment, Sustainable Energy, Tourism and Hospitality, Biotechnology, Cultural and Cre-ative Industry, and High Quality Agriculture.</p>
